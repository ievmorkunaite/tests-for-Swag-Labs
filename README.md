# Automated tests for Swag Labs

This repository is used for me to learn test automation. It contains automated tests for the Swag Labs web application, specifically targeting its functionality and user experience using Playwright. The tests are designed to cover various scenarios such as login, product browsing, cart interactions, and checkout processes.

# Setup:

- `npm i` -> node v20.17.0
- `npm init playwright@latest` -> install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)

# Useful commands

- `npx playwright test` -> to run tests
- `npx playwright codegen`

# Credits

The test plans and test cases for the project were co-written by me and [María José Domínguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-jose-dominguez/).
